<h2>Commercial Solutions Offering (CSO) Overview</h2>


<h2>End User Problem/Need</h2>


Operational Units often find good technology that can solve their problem but can’t find a way to get them on contract. Those units are traditionally not good at writing Performance Work Statement’s (PWS). This results in the local CONS office awarding a contract to the lowest price, which likely isn’t the company that the operational unit wanted, and the product the end user ends up with may not be able to solve their problem. Another common scenario is where government has a problem and doesn’t know if there’s a commercial solution. Both scenarios can result in the operational unit wasting months of time, getting frustrated, and ending up exactly where they started. 

<h2>What is a CSO/Legal Authority</h2>


A [CSO](https://aaf.dau.mil/contracting-cone/defense-cso/) is an innovative contracting method where a problem statement is posted to FBO targeting non-traditional vendors to bring new technology to the government.  This solicitation can be specific (I.E. Machine Learning Software targeting Flight Crew scheduling for C-17 crew), or broad (I.E. machine learning technology).  CSOs were authorized in [National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year](https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/policy/policyvault/USA001228-18-DPAP.pdf) 2017 and AFICA has published [guidance](https://cs2.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/knowledge_center/Documents/Contracting_Memos/Policy/18-C-03.pdf) reaffirming the use of CSOs at the base level. 

<h2>Benefits of a CSO</h2>




1. User doesn’t have to type of exact requirements package. This solicitation defines the problem and allows the vendor to bring the solution to the customer.
2. Gives the user the ability to select the exact product/vendor they want and can choose the vendor with what he believes is the best product instead of the traditional way of lowest price. 
3. Allows user the ability to choose multiple vendors for the same problem/requirement
4. Decreases the acquisition timeline (as little as 2 months)

<h2>CSO Timeline</h2>


The below timeline is an example of how quickly this process can be done and not a mandate on how all CSOs should go. For example, CSOs that receive more bids may want a longer evaluation phase, or multiple pitch days.

<h2>Paperwork Required</h2>


Below is an example of the paperwork that may be involved with a CSO.

<h2>Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB MDL) CSO</h2>


JB MDL conducted a broad CSO focusing on [4 problem statements](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=8808e56f844a6747ca734cc124f17670&tab=core&_cview=1). Of the 72 bids that JB MDL received, 2 companies did not meet JB MDL’s small business criteria, 8 companies were excluded due to lack of SAM registration prior to the pitch day. After the vetting process, 10 companies came out to the pitch day, and 5 companies were awarded a contract that day. From start to finish their whole process took 55 days, starting on 18 April and ending on 10 June.
