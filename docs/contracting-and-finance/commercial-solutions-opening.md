# Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO)

## What is a CSO and Why Would I Use It?

A Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) is for when you have a problem but don’t quite know how to solve it. CSOs let companies come to you with what they think the solution is to your problem. Instead of you spending your off-duty time trying to solve a problem you are facing, CSOs let commercial industry compete to solve your problem for you.

CSOs allow commercial industry to rapidly respond to your problem statement with a simplified “pitch” that is much leaner than traditional contract proposals. You are empowered to maintain ownership of your problem throughout the entire process and, as the expert on your problem, will help to evaluate the solutions industry brings to you.

You will likely see a wide variety of solutions proposed to your problem statement, increasing your knowledge of the existing commercial solution space. You are under no obligation to fund any of the proposals that you receive.

Once you select a solution to your problem statement and sign the contract (often during a single pitch day), you immediately begin partnering with your vendor to deliver that solution. Typical end-to-end turnaround times from problem statement to vendor partnering are as fast as 2 months.

## Ok I’m In! How Do I Use a CSO?

You need to develop your problem statement. It helps industry to solve your problem if they understand your organization’s mission, so include a description of that too. We have attached several examples of good problem statements below.

Partner with your contracting office. Take your problem statement and mission description to your contracting office and see if a CSO is the right solution for you. Even if a CSO isn’t the perfect fit, there are many different contracting avenues that can potentially meet your needs.

**Joint Base MDL Pitch Day Delivers Results!**

At the Joint Base MDL Pitch Day on June 10, 2019, the 87th Contracting Squadron awarded five one-page contracts for innovative products and services. While the Pitch Day event was a huge success, the goal was to deliver technology to increase readiness and lethality across the joint base.   Many of these products have been delivered and Airmen are already testing them on the flight line and in their work centers. Companies who participated in Joint Base MDL Pitch Day, including those who were unsuccessful, are finding new opportunities to provide their technologies to Department of Defense customers.
